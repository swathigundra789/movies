    <h1>RAABTA</h1>
    <P>Raabta (transl. Connection) is a 2017 Indian Hindi-language romantic drama film directed by Dinesh Vijan in his directorial debut and co-produced by Vijan, Homi Adajania, and Bhushan Kumar. It stars actors Sushant Singh Rajput and Kriti Sanon, with Jim Sarbh, Rajkummar Rao, and Varun Sharma in supporting roles. The story is based on the concept of reincarnated star-crossed lovers.

        The film had faced controversy from producer Allu Aravind of Geetha Arts, who claimed that the film's storyline and characters strongly resembled those of the studio's 2009 film Magadheera.[1] It received mixed-to-negative reviews from critics and was a commercial failure, grossing ₹39 crore at the worldwide box office.[2]</P>
