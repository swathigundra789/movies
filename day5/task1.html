    <h1>deavara part 1</h1>
    <p>Devara: Part 1 is a 2024 Indian Telugu-language action drama film[8] written and directed by Koratala Siva and produced by Yuvasudha Arts and N. T. R. Arts. The film stars N. T. Rama Rao Jr in dual roles, alongside with an ensemble cast of Saif Ali Khan, Janhvi Kapoor, Prakash Raj, Srikanth, and Shine Tom Chacko. It marks the Telugu cinema debut of Khan and Kapoor. The plot follows Devara (Rao), chieftain of a coastal village who is engaged in bloody feud with his counterpart Bhaira (Khan) over arms smuggling. The conflict, which starts as a personal vendetta, quickly escalates into a much larger power play that threatens to disrupt the entire region.

        The film was officially announced in April 2021 under the tentative title NTR30, as it is Rama Rao's 30th film as a lead actor, and the official title was announced in May 2023. In late-2023, the film was split into two-parts. Principal photography for this part commenced in April 2023 and wrapped in August 2024. Filming took place in Hyderabad, Shamshabad, Visakhapatnam, Goa and Thailand. The film has music composed by Anirudh Ravichander, cinematography handled by R. Rathnavelu and editing by A. Sreekar Prasad. </p>

      <p>The police capture Yethi's henchman and interrogate him. They learn Yethi was going to see Muruga, a politician-cum-smuggler. Learning that Muruga is dead, they go undercover as smugglers. They approach DSP Tulasi who tells them to visit the Red Sea villages in the Ratnagiri mountains on the Andhra Pradesh-Tamil Nadu border. They visit Bhaira, chief of one of the village, and threaten him to smuggle goods, only to be violently rejected by him. They find Singappa, who takes them offshore in a boat. Task Force Officer Shivam tries to make an offer to him by showing off a diamond ring which is abruptly thrown into the sea by Singappa. As Shivam dives in to retrieve the ring, he finds human skeletons on the seabed, terrifying him. Singappa starts narrating the story which begins 12 years earlier.

        Inhabitants of the villages were once warriors defending the seas, but after India got its Independence, they lose relevance, reduced to becoming smugglers in the infamous Red Sea. Devara is a chieftain of one of the villages and part of the group which smuggles for Muruga from the merchant ships, along with Bhaira. Unbeknownst to them, the loot is illegal arms which are used in robberies, and one such incident occurs near their villages. During a smuggling expedition, they are caught by the coast guard and the commander of the vessel, Irfan, reveals the items they were smuggling and how he expected honour among the descendants of warriors.</p>
