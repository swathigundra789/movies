        <p>This movie starts in 1980 when friends celebrate their farewell party. They promise each other to keep in touch. Among them are Hanumanta Rao, who has a son named Prabha, and Vishwanath who has a daughter named Nandini. To reach their professional goals, Vishwanath and Nandini travel to Switzerland, while Hanumanta Rao becomes a criminal lawyer and settles in India. Thus, Prabha and Nandini get separated in their childhood.

            Years later, these old friends call for a reunion where a grown-up Prabha, a musician, is eager to see his lover Nandini after many years, but Nisha, the daughter of a local don, attempts suicide when Prabha does not accept her love. Her father tries to kill Prabha and his friends, but Prabha gets out of trouble by faking a story about how him and his band traveled to Switzerland and how he fell in love with Nandini.</p>
